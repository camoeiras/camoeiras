### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## I'm a person who's not the guy who programs, who only makes machine learning models, who does exploratory analysis and knows the main libraries in Python. Not just that.

## I'm a professional who understands he's paid to solve problems.

## Who thinks in a systemic way, seeking to understand the best metrics, best and worst case scenario, define scope, structures problems, apply methodologies and works communication skills and storytelling.

## It's not just code. Understand this from an early age and never be merely cheap labor.
